My 			interests span across a variety of subjects. Some of my interests include web/mobile app development, software development, big data, 3d modeling, and anything having to 			do with financial markets.</p>
		  <p>This website is for showcasing some of my projects and the skills that went into making them. In addition, I'm using this website as a, sort of, testing ground for any 			web development techniques I want to try out.</p> <p>W.I.P STILL</p></div>
